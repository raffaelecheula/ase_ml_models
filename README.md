# ASE ML Models

## Overview

`ase_ml_models` is a Python package designed to apply machine learning models to surface kinetics data derived from atomistic simulations. It leverages the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) for setting up, manipulating, and analyzing atomistic simulations, providing tools to integrate machine learning techniques into surface kinetics studies.

## Installation

To install `ase_ml_models`, clone the repository and install the package using `pip`:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/raffaelecheula/ase_ml_models.git
cd ase_ml_models
pip install .
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.5 or later
- Numpy
- [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Usage

The package provides modules and functions to preprocess surface kinetics data, train machine learning models, and analyze the results. Example scripts demonstrating typical workflows are available in the `examples` directory of the repository.
